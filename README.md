# EU-DREAM Project: Task 2.1

This repository constitutes the files for **Task 2.1 (Appliance Modeling)** of the EU-DREAM project, providing validated, dynamic system models of household appliances and a residential thermal environment engineered for energy management (Demand Response) analysis.

## Task Overview

The models are structured for modular integration and feature high-fidelity component modeling essential for simulating the impact of smart control and price signals on household energy consumption.

Key Model Components:

* **Washing Machine Model:** Complete Simscape-based hydraulic and electromechanical model including the motor, drum dynamics, and hydraulic circuit.
* **Thermal House Model:** A high-fidelity thermodynamic model of a residential structure, simulating heat flow, thermal inertia, and indoor temperature regulation.
* **Refrigerator Model:** A thermal storage and refrigeration cycle model capturing compressor cycling, energy consumption, and internal temperature dynamics.
* **Energy Management Logic:** Integrated User Intervention logic combining **Manual Override** and **Peak Price Thresholds** to enforce load curtailment during high-cost events.

All models and Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) are organized into dedicated folders as permanent and open-access.
